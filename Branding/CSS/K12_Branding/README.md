K12 Branding Template
===========

This template will allow a basic start to branding Canvas. It is meant to work with Canvas and the K12 specific features coming to Canvas.

The file K12_Round_Icons.css will be used when not using the K12 specific functions.

The file K12_Canvas_Header.css will be used when using the Canvas K12 specific features, through Feature Flags on the account level.


Setup
=====

You will want to host this behind a secure server (HTTPS), then copy the link (https://link.com/to/the/css/file.css) in the global CSS overrides at the root account, or specific sub-account you are branding.


Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
