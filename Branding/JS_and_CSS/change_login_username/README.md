Customizing the Top Menu with JavaScript 
======

This code allows you to  change the text in the email box on the Canvas login page. 
By default, the text in the box is "Email" but this script will allow you to change this.  

To make this change, include the JS and CSS in your global JavaScript file and CSS file, 
respectively. See http://guides.instructure.com/s/2204/m/4214/l/41896-how-do-i-brand-my-canvas-instance 
to learn more about these files. 

When implementing this script, replace `<replacement>` with the text you want to appear.
For example, you may want to have that text be "NetID" rather than "email".  


Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
