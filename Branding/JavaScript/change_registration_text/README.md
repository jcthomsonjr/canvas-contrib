Change Registration Text
======

This script describes how you would change the "I forgot my password" text on the Canvas Login page.

*Note:* When implementing this script, replace <replacement> with the text you want to appear. For example, you may want to have that text be "Help me find my password" rather than "I forgot my password".


Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
