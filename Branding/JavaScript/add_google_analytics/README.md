Track your Account with Google Analytics
======

This script describes how you could add Google Analytics to your Account in Canvas.

To use this script, include it in your global javascript file.  See
http://guides.instructure.com/s/2204/m/4214/l/41896-how-do-i-brand-my-canvas-instance to learn more about this file.

When implementing this script, replace `<your_ga_#_here>` with your Google Analytics
number.  


Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
