Hiding Grades with JavaScript and CSS
======

The hidden_grades.* files contained in this folder can be used to
temporarily hide grades from students. It is essential to note that this
is not a perfect solution- the JavaScript used to strip grades depends
on a JavaScript-enabled browser. An intelligent or determined student
could still find a way to view their grades.

Hiding grades is contingent on the course instructor removing the
"Grades" link from the course's navigation. This can be done by using
the "Navigation" tab in the course's "Settings" section. Once removed,
grades will be inaccessible to students. By default, grades will be
available to all.

Instructure may releas an update to Canvas that will
include the ability to hide grades from students. It is recommended that
institutions wait for this. If, however, the ability to hide
grades is considered essential in the short run, the included files can
help form a stop-gap solution.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
