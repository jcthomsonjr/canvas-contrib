Hide Password Link in Settings
======

This script will hide the password change option that appears in settings for students. Teachers, admins, and observers will still have the ability to change the password.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
