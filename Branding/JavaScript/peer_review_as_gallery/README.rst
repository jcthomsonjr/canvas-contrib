Information about the scripts in this folder
============================================


pr_gallery_

When a user is viewing an assignment submission, the file does not automatically
preview for images (maybe not other filetypes either).  This javascript makes uploaded
images render below the "File Uploads" box.

Disclaimer: This script is distributed with no guarantee, warrantee, or any other type
of '-antee'.  No support is provided either.  You use at your own judgement and need to understand
that your are responsible for it working or not working.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
