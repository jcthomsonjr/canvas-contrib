Change Color of Courses Dropdown
======

This snippet allows you to change the color of a course/courses listed in the Courses dropdown, based off a keyword in the course name

Originally used because an institution wanted their template/master courses (with "Template" in the name) to stick out separately from their other courses

<KEYWORD> replace with the text string the course(s) in question contain(s)
<COLOR> replace with the color you'd like to change the course name to. Can be color name ("green"), hex value ("#2E9524"), etc.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
