Merge Multiple Users
=========

There needs to be a column named `merged`, this is going to be the user account you want to become the primary account once merged.

There needs to be another column named `to_be_merged`, this is going to be the account that is merged into the primary account.

Please reference the merge_users.csv file for an example.

*Note:* Headers are required & both columns need to be the SIS ID of the user.
